Adding an oil rig to Scrap Mechanic

## About

This mod adds a new variant of the Vacuum Pump, which exclusively pumps oil. (Other mods just *extend* the pump, making it so that you have to deal with all of the excess water!)

Find it in the Craftbot, under Interactive. The icon looks identical to a Vacuum Pump, but the model itself will be black-ish.

Place it above a geyser, connect it to a chest and a trigger, and turn it on.

Congrats, you are now an oil tycoon!

## Installation

Run `ruby apply_mod.rb` to install it.

## Uninstallation

`ruby apply_mod.rb undo` will uninstall it to the best of its ability, but there may be some crud left over. As of writing this, the only leftover should be the icon map, which shouldn't hurt anything.

As always, the most reliable way to uninstall survival mods is to go to Steam => Scrap Mechanic => Properties => Local Files => Verify Integrity.

### Warning!

If you have an oil pump in your world, you must remove it before uninstalling the mod, or your world will fail to load!

You can re-install to make your world load again.
